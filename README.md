# UltraFast™ ascii animation console visualizer fully written in rust
This project is a Rust program designed to display ASCII animations in the console. It is compatible with both Windows and Linux systems. The ASCII animations are generated by the project **[img2art](https://github.com/Asthestarsfalll/img2art)**.

## Precompiled Releases
For optimal speed and convenience, precompiled releases for both Linux, Windows & Mac are available. You can download the appropriate binary for your system from the releases page.

Once downloaded, you can run the program using the following command:
```sh
# On Windows
.\rustyAscii.exe .\gif.txt

# On Linux
./rustyAscii ./gif.txt
```

In this example, rustyAscii.exe is the downloaded binary and gif.txt is the ASCII art file you want to display. Please replace .\gif.txt with the path to your ASCII art file.

This method provides a faster startup time compared to building and running the project from source.

## Usage
To use this program, you need to pass the ASCII art file as a command-line argument. The usage is as follows:
```sh
cargo run <filename>
```

Where <filename> is the path to the ASCII art file you want to display.

## Dependencies
This project only uses one non std crate:

**crossterm**: for cursor manipulation in the console across platforms.

## Building and Running
To build and run the project, you need to have Rust installed. You can then use the following commands:
```sh
# To build the project
cargo build

# To run the project
cargo run <filename>
```
Please replace `<filename>` with the path to your ASCII art file.
