# UltraFast ascii animation console visualizer display fully written in rust and cross-compatible for all os systemsâ„¢
This project is a Rust program designed to display ASCII animations in the console. It is compatible with both Windows and Linux systems. The ASCII animations are generated by the project **[img2art](https://github.com/Asthestarsfalll/img2art)**.

## Precompiled Releases
For optimal speed and convenience, precompiled releases for Linux, Windows & Mac are available. You can download the appropriate binary for your system from the releases page.

Once downloaded, you can run the program using the following command:
```sh
# On Windows
.\rustyAscii.exe .\gif.txt

# On Linux
./rustyAscii ./gif.txt
```

In this example, rustyAscii.exe is the downloaded binary and gif.txt is the ASCII art file you want to display. Please replace .\gif.txt with the path to your ASCII art file.
I use this method to display animated ascii art inside alpha-nvim on windows.

## Building and Running
To build and run the project, you need to have Rust installed. You can then use the following commands:
```sh
# To build the project
cargo build

# To run the project
cargo run <filename>
```
Please replace `<filename>` with the path to your ASCII art file.
